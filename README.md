# Financial News Stock Price Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the impact of financial news on stock prices using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to determine how news articles influence stock market movements and to create predictive models based on this data.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and model training.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory where datasets are stored.
- `models/`: Directory where trained models are saved.
- `results/`: Directory where results and figures are stored.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Tekalig/financial_news_stock_price_analysis.git
   cd financial_news_stock_price_analysis
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data and train models.
2. Use the scripts in the `scripts/` directory for data preprocessing and model evaluation.

### Example

To run the analysis, start with the `data_exploration.ipynb` notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb
```

## Data

The data used in this project includes historical stock prices and financial news articles. Ensure the data is placed in the `data/` directory.

## Models

The project uses various machine learning models to predict stock price movements based on news sentiment. Models are trained and evaluated in the Jupyter Notebooks.

## Results

Results and analysis figures are saved in the `results/` directory.
